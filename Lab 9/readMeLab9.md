## Task

I created a basic chat app with the socket.io, express, https and mysql modules. This application requires people to login in or sign up which is checked/saved to the database. They are then allowed to chat with anyone else that is online and logged in. The chat displays the users name and the message is sent. For now the chat is not saved to the database but I plan to add that in the future.
