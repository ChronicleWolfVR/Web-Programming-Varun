# Explanations for Checklist

## Branching

The purpose of branching is to allow you to work on a feature or bugfix without affecting the main codebase. You can create a new branch, make changes, and then merge those changes back into the main branch when you're ready. It also allows you to build new features without affecting the main codebase until you're ready to merge.

## ReadMe

The purpose of a README file is to provide information about the project. It should include a description of the project, how to install it, how to use it, and any other information that might be useful to someone who wants to use the project. They also include details about the project's license, contributors, and other information that might be useful to someone who wants to contribute to the project.
